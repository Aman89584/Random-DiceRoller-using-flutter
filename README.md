In This project, we build a random dice roller with the help of a flutter. 
It Contains four dart files one of its main files is where our full app is assembled and running and the next one is the background gradients changer and the other one is for the Random-Dice-Roller, and one is also for text styling dart files. 
With these files, you can also build your own small project.
